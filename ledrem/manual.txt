HOW TO

- Unpack all files (also SOX, which is into a separated .zip) into the same folder;

- Edit lirc2ledrem.ini to match your system: you must specify SOX's path, output path for LIRC2LEDREM, and path where RAW2LIRC saves its output, which is read by LIRC2LEDREM;

- Sample your remote as described here:

- Save sample as .WAV file (mono/44100);

- Load .WAV into RAW2LIRC: program will create a text file LIRC-compatible (you can load many WAV at the same time).
NOTE: you should edit the .WAV file before passing it to RAW2LIRC, in such a way that there is no silence before the actual signal. Resulting file should be only a few milliseconds long, and it must contain only ONE occurrence of the key-code;

- Load into LIRC2LEDREM the text file you just created (or, hopefully, any "raw format" LIRC file); LIRC2LEDREM will create one .BAT file per each key you sampled;

- Launch batch files to create the WAV files which you'll then copy on the phone;

- Play on the phone the WAV files; you'll need a player supporting WAV, such as FIVN player or Real Player;
